# Matrix Manipulation

This repository consists of one class, MatrixManipulation, that contains some methods I have written to manipulate matrices of any size. Currently, it contains a getDeterminant() method, an inverse() method, and a transpose() method.

I created this class for use in NextPlay as well as other Sports Regression Projects.
